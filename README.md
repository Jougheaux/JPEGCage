## JPEG Cage
This cage was originally designed for my blaster [JPEG](https://github.com/Jougheaux/JPEG). This repo exists to publish general files for implementing JPEG cage and wheel geometry into other projects

## Thank Yous
I was the one working on the CAD, but this couldn't have been done without the efforts of the "RPI Nerf Industrial Complex" and members of the nerf community.
- Adrian Kelly/ KellyIndustries supplied their new [plus motors](https://kellyindustries.us/collections/flywheel-parts/products/plus-motor-brushless)
- [Brad](https://thefactoryamsterdam.com/) [Roboman](https://roboman.net/) for giving me bearings and being a cool dude

## To Do
- Stryfe variant
- Examples
- BCAR kits
